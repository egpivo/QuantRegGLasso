Description: Implements an adaptively weighted group Lasso procedure for simultaneous variable selection and structure identification in varying
  coefficient quantile regression models and additive quantile regression models with ultra-high dimensional covariates. The methodology, grounded
  in a strong sparsity condition, establishes selection consistency under certain weight conditions. To address the challenge of tuning parameter 
  selection in practice, a BIC-type criterion named high-dimensional information criterion (HDIC) is proposed. The Lasso procedure, guided by
  HDIC-determined tuning parameters, maintains selection consistency. Theoretical findings are strongly supported by simulation studies.
